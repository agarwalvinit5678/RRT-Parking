### Abstract
Autonomous parking technology is a key concept
within autonomous driving research. This paper will propose
an imaginative autonomous parking algorithm to solve issues
concerned with parking. The proposed algorithm consists of
three parts: an imaginative model for anticipating results before
parking, an improved rapid-exploring random tree (RRT) for
planning a feasible trajectory from a given start point to a
parking lot, and a path smoothing module for optimizing the
efficiency of parking tasks. Our algorithm is based on a real
kinematic vehicle model; which makes it more suitable for
algorithm application on real autonomous cars. Furthermore,
due to the introduction of the imagination mechanism, the
processing speed of our algorithm is ten times faster than that
of traditional methods, permitting the realization of real-time
planning simultaneously. In order to evaluate the algorithmâ€™s
effectiveness, we have compared our algorithm with traditional
RRT ,within three different parking scenarios. Ultimately,
results show that our algorithm is more stable than traditional
RRT and performs better in terms of efficiency and quality.
